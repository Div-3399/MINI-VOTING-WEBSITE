                <h2>What is online voting ?</h2>
                <h3>A brief introduction to casting ballots online</h3>
                <p>
                    At the end of any political term, millions of voters are called upon to cast their votes for their
                    next political representatives. Unfortunately, many eligible voters will not be able to reach a
                    polling station during the election. <br>
                    Some are living abroad or are deployed in the military. Some have disabilities and face inaccessible
                    polling locations. Some simply don’t have the means to take the time to vote, whether it be due to a
                    job, to travels, or to living far away from a voting center. <br><br>
                    <img src="images/lines1.png" alt=""><br>
                    But if citizens could vote from anywhere, and at any time, then these hurdles wouldn’t exist. <br>
                    This is exactly where online voting comes in. It gives voters the possibility to easily and
                    comfortably fill out and cast a ballot using their own personal computer or smartphone, allowing
                    them to vote from virtually any location with Internet access. <br>

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                    For a voter, online voting is comprised of three main steps: <br>
                    <img src="images/lines2.png" alt="">
                <h4>Registration</h4>
                To register to vote, voters are added to an electoral roll of eligible voters, as with any election.
                They are then provided with credentials, such as a username and password, to access the voting system.
                <h4>Voting</h4>
                Voters can cast a ballot by opening the election website from an Internet browser, identifying
                themselves (with their username and password, for example), and selecting their voting choices. Then all
                they need to do is click on the “cast” button.
                <h4>Verification</h4>
                Verification is the last step, and it is usually optional, enabling voters to verify that their ballot
                was correctly registered by the voting system.
                </p>

            <div class="lines">
                <h3>Why use it</h3>
                <p>
                    Although voting alternatives exist for those who can’t fill out a standard ballot on election day,
                    they are far from perfect. Postal voting methods leave little room for slow mail services and have
                    no way for voters to verify that their ballot was correctly counted and not tampered with.
                    Similarly, services for people with disabilities usually require them to forfeit their voter privacy
                    by asking someone to vote on their behalf or telling a poll worker which option they would like to
                    elect. <br>
                    Online Voting, on the other hand, offers the benefits of these alternatives without any of the
                    drawbacks. With online voting, every voter is guaranteed an accessible and secure voting method,
                    their votes remain private and confidential, and they can participate in an election from anywhere,
                    at any time.
